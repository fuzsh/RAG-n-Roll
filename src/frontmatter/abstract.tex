    Ensuring the accuracy of data inside knowledge graphs is essential in a time when information management is depending more and more on automated methods.
    This thesis uses retrieval-augmented generating (RAG) to provide a fresh method for fact verification in knowledge graphs.
    Combining large language models, information retrieval methods, and a multi-stage verification procedure, the proposed pipeline evaluates the veracity of facts expressed in knowledge graphs.
    Important elements consist of query generation from knowledge graph triples, web search integration for external evidence retrieval, embedding-based document chunking and retrieval, and an ensemble of language models for fact verification.
    The system synthesizes outputs from several models by using adaptive dispute resolution techniques and majority voting.
    Extensive studies assess several text chunking techniques, embedding models, and document choosing procedures.
    Results show areas for more optimization as well as the efficiency of the suggested method in verifying knowledge graph truths.
    This effort advances the developing domains of knowledge base curation and automated fact checking.
