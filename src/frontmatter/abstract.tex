    Ensuring the truthfulness of knowledge graphs is critical as they serve as foundational tools in powering many AI systems, search engines, and decision-support systems.
    This thesis proposes a novel approach using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to verify facts in knowledge graphs.
    The system combines large language models, information retrieval techniques, and a multi-stage verification process to evaluate the veracity of knowledge graph facts.
    Key components include generating queries from knowledge graph triples, integrating web search for external evidence retrieval, employing embedding-based document chunking and retrieval, and utilizing an ensemble of language models for fact verification.
    The system aggregates outputs from multiple models using adaptive dispute resolution techniques and majority voting.
    Comprehensive experiments evaluate various text chunking techniques, embedding models, and document selection procedures.
    Results demonstrate both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in verifying knowledge graph facts and areas for further optimization.
    This work advances the evolving fields of knowledge base curation and automated fact checking.
